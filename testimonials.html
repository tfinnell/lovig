						<h1>Testimonials</h1>

						<div class="testimonial">
							<p>Having a reading by Heather is a spiritual experience. Every time she reads for me it is
							transmitted with an aura of love, compassion, and a desire to support my highest good.
							I appreciate that her readings come through in many forms; power animals will show
							up, colors emerge, spirits offer guidance, even loved ones can make an appearance. She
							offers a reading that I feel addresses me in a much more holistic way than readings that
							only use cards, or only channel one guide. Heather is an exceptional container for Divine
							Guidance and I believe an embodiment of the Divine Feminine on this plane. When you
							are with Heather, you are in the presence of angels, faeries, love and wisdom in the form
							of Heather Lovig.<br />
							~Kimberly Gibbons</p>

						<div class="testimonial">
							<p>I have had the pleasure of knowing Heather for many years now and have sought out her
							healing and intuitive guidance on many occasions. Heather is a very clear and accurate
							intuitive channel and has the ability to channel many different healing energies for the
							benefit of the client. It is very healing to be in contact with Heather's presence. She is
							very compassionate and accepting and can lovingly work with many of the darker and
							more challenging issues that one has. I highly recommend any one to work with her.<br />
							~Brent Pilegard, intuitive counselor</p>

						<div class="testimonial">
							<p>Having sessions with Heather has been extremely valuable for my personal growth
							and understanding. Heather is able to perceive at a deep level what is happening within
							me emotionally and spiritually. This is itself is very affirming, insightful, and has given
							me direction for what to focus on to move through difficult times. She communicates
							these insights in ways that are clear with specific suggestions of what to work with for
							transformation and growth. Heather is very supportive, kind, warm, and easy to talk
							with. She has helped with my process of trusting and listening to myself, which has been
							invaluable. I highly recommend Heather for empowering and giving understanding to the
							transformation that is within you."<br />
