							<h3>Comprehensive Bodywork</h3>
							<p>Even though Heather describes the types of energy work she does as separate:
							Angel Care Bodywork, Reiki and Energetic Clearing, this is done solely for the
							benefit of the reader to illicit a better understanding of what comprises her healing
							work.</p> 
							<p>It is Heather's experience that even though there are different types of energy work, 
							all are intrinsically related and just another facet or expression of the same
							healing energy. Therefore when she works with someone, her work can extend
							beyond just Reiki, Angel Care and Energy Clearings. It depends on the client and the
							work that needs to be done. Heather can tailor her healing work to fit your needs.</p>

							<h3>Types of Bodywork</h3>
							<div id="bodywork-angelcare">

								<img src="images/logos/angel.png" alt="Angel Care" />
								<h4>Angel Care Bodywork</h4>
								<p>Angel Care Bodywork is a term that Heather has developed to describe the roles,
								ongoing assistance and energy that the angels contribute to the healing process.</p>
								<p>When Heather is working with a client, many times their angels are present, guiding,
								channeling through her and working alongside her to bring healing and balance. The
								angels are very powerful, special beings and have their own significant touch and
								powerful energy that they bring to the session.</p>
							</div>
							<div id="bodywork-reiki">
								<img src="images/logos/reiki.png" alt="Reiki Massage" />

								<h4>Reiki Massage</h4>
								<p>Reiki is an energetic healing modality in which Heather channels life force energy
								through the laying of the hands to restore physical, emotional, mental and spiritual
								balance to a person. It was developed by Mikao Usui in the 1900's in Japan and is 
								an extremely powerful healing method.</p>
							</div>
							<div id="bodywork-energeticclearing">
								<img src="images/logos/energeticclearing.png" alt="Energetic Clearing" />
								<h4>Energetic Clearing</h4>
								<p>Energetic Clearing is energy work that directly focuses on clearing, cleansing and
								removing residual energy from a person's auric field.</p>

								<p>Often times people can pick up energy from places they've been, absorb mental and emotional energy from
								other people and have their own residual energy stuck in their field that is ready to
								leave. </p>
								<p>In a session, Heather will clear these energies as well as any other energies
								that don't belong in the person's aura. She will then give specific personalized
								information and tips on things her client can do to maintain their cleared energy
								field.</p>
							</div>
						</div>
						<div id="bodywork-disclaimer">
							<h3>Disclaimer</h3>
							<div>
								<img src="images/logos/nurse.png" alt="Not a nurse" height="160" width="160" />

								<p>Heather is not a licensed health care practitioner nor does she have any
								medical training. Her work is purely focused on the energetic components of
								the body. </p>
							</div>
							<div>
								<img src="images/logos/caduceus.png" alt="Caduceus"/>
								<p>Although some have experienced the added bonus of an alleviation
								of certain physical symptoms, this type of bodywork is not meant to replace
								professional medical treatment if that is what's needed. </p>
							</div>
							<div>
								<p>Energetic bodywork has been known to manifest emotional and physical symptoms in certain
								individuals and is something that can't be predicted but depends on the
								individual person and what was worked with energetically in the session.</p>

								<p>Most times this is apart of the healing process. However if there are any
								concerns that come up, Heather provides a free 20 minute follow up session,
								in which she can provide further counsel and guidance on how to process,
								work with, and integrate what has surfaced from the session.</p>
