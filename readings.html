							<h3>Why get a reading?</h3>
							<p>Often times the underlying reason why many people come for a reading is because they
							are looking for hope that things will be o.k., wanting to feel security in their life or are
							looking for answers that will alleviate their fears.</p>
							<p>Heather knows that to open yourself up and ask questions about your life can emote feelings of vulnerability. Therefore when she
							gives a reading, a safe container is created and everything spoken between you and her
							stays confidential.</p>
						</div>
						<div id="readings-types">
							<h3>Types of Readings</h3>
							<p>Heather's reading style is eclectic and mainly composed of these three
							components when she gives a reading:</p>
							<div id="readings-psychic">
								<img src="images/logos/psychic.png" alt="Psychic Readings" />
								<h4>Psychic Abilities</h4>
								<p>Heather receives psychic information through her clairvoyance (images, symbols, colors),
								clairaudience (hearing voices and words), clairsentient (feeling) and claircognizance
								(knowing) abilities. She is also an Empath (can feel/sense the emotions of a person, place
								or any living thing) and can work with your past lives.</p>

							</div>
							<div id="readings-mediumship">
								<img src="images/logos/mediumship.png" alt="mediumship" />
								<h4>Mediumship</h4>
								<p>Heather often times will receive and channel messages from many different sources such
								as: the Divine, spirit guides, deities, ascended masters, the deceased, angels and power
								animals, to name a few. She acts as the translator, relaying the messages of guidance to
								the person receiving the reading.</p>
							</div>
							<div id="readings-guidance">
								<img src="images/logos/compass.png" alt="guidance" />

								<h4>Spiritual Guidance/Counseling</h4>
								<p>As a part of the reading process, not only does Heather channel messages and use her
								psychic gifts to answer your questions, but also helps you get to the root of why you are
								asking a question, provides counsel and guidance with the answers once received and
								addresses additional resources for how to integrate the information into your life. It is
								Heather's experience that to have a successful reading, this is a necessary and important
								part of the process.</p>
							</div>
						</div>
						<div id="readings-expectations">
							<h3>Expectations</h3>
							<div id="readings-predictions">
								<img src="images/logos/crystalball.png" alt="not a fortune teller" />

								<h4>Heather Is Not A Fortune Teller.</h4>
								<p>Although she does have the gift of foresight, she will not give readings that are solely
								composed of prediction questions or future based questions.
								<p>The intention behind her work is to help others with healing, guidance, and clarification 
								through her gifts as a psychic, channel, medium, and spiritual counselor. It is when someone 
								comes to the session really looking for guidance and help in their life that the readings are 
								the most accurate and effective.</p>
							</div>
							<div id="readings-connections">
								<img src="images/logos/connection.png" alt="connections" />
								<h4>Sometimes a connection can't be made.</h4>
								<p>Many times a person comes to a reading with the expectation that all of their questions
								will be answered or that they'll be able to communicate with their deceased loved one,
								spirit guides, etc. </p>

								<p>It is important for you to know that sometimes a question asked, can't
								be answered. This could be because a clear reading can't be made of the energy around
								the person, situation, or your not meant to know the answer. </p>
								<p>Also, if you are looking to connect with a specific type of energy such as a certain 
								spirit guide or deceased loved one, Heather will make "the call" for them to be present, 
								however it is ultimately up to that energy to respond back and communicate.</p>
							</div>	
						</div>
						<div id="readings-preparation">	
							<h3>How To Prepare For A Reading</h3>
							<div id="readings-nodrugs">
								<img src="images/logos/nodrugs.png" alt="no drugs" />
								<h4>Drug Policy</h4>

								<p> Please abstain from using drugs or alcohol 48 hours before the reading. Drugs and alcohol can cloud a person's energetic field, which can make it a hard to give an accurate
								reading and for the person to absorb the information. If you are taking a necessary
								prescription drug that doesn't impair your functioning or mental processes, this should be
								fine.</p>
							</div>
							<div id="readings-questions">
								<img src="images/logos/questions.png" alt="questions" />
								<h4>Questions</h4>
								<p>Have specific questions in mind, really focusing on the most pertinent ones.
								Also, don't ask a question you really don't want the answer too, this is important and
								something you must differentiate on your own.</p>
							</div>

							<div id="readings-invitations">
								<img src="images/logos/rsvp.png" alt="Invite any necessary spirits" />
								<h4>Invitations</h4>
								<p>If you would like to connect with a deceased loved one (person or pet), your spirit
								guide, angels, etc. as apart of the session, Heather suggest to invite them to be apart of the
								reading before attending the session. This isn't necessary but does make it more likely
								that they will show up because the person themselves has requested it.</p>
							</div>
						</div>
						<div id="readings-caveats">
							<h3>Caveats</h3>

							<div id="readings-future">
								<img src="images/logos/future.png" alt="future" />
								<h4>Future Based Questions</h4>
								<p>Heather can see the future, however what she sees is based on the way you are projecting
								your energy in that current moment in time as well as how others are projecting their
								energy, in relation to the question. Therefore what is seen during the reading can
								potentially change and a different outcome can happen based on the circumstances of
								life. Also, based on the question, she may see one or many probable futures, and if this
								is the case, can give you guidance on how to make the most ideal possibility a reality for
								yourself.</p>
							</div>
							<div id="readings-caveats-others">
								<img src="images/logos/others.png" alt="others" />
								<h4>Questions About Others</h4>

								<p>Heather has the upmost respect for another person's privacy on a psychic level. Therefore
								when a question is asked about another person, she will first check in with their spirit
								and get permission before continuing. Sometimes access isn't granted or only limited
								information is given or can be read.</p>		
							</div>
							
							<p class="important">* Heather is not a licensed therapist or counselor and her work should not be
								substituted for that of a mental health professional*</p>
